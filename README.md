# Duarte Silva's Profile Page

This is as simple, clean, and responsive personal site built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a little big of JavaScript. It has links to my social media profiles, projects, and a brief description about me. It also has a dark/light toggle button for better usability.

## Features

-   Accessibility features, which I had no idea existed, but are pretty cool
-   Responsive layout with centered content that adapts to mobile and desktop
-   Dark mode toggle with smooth transitions
-   Background topography pattern with subtle opacity
-   Sections for About, Where to Find Me, Projects, and Contact

## Tech Stack

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (Pure CSS with variables for theming both dark and light mode)
-   JavaScript (Typing animation for the page title and dark mode toggle slider)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the source code or fork it for your own use.
