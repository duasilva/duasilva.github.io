# Duarte Silva's Profile Page

Welcome to my profile page!

This is a simple, clean, and responsive page that I've built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It showcases my social media profiles, projects, and a little about me.

## Features

-   Accessibility features (I had no idea how many accessibility options there were, pretty cool!)
-   Custom styling with JetBrains Mono font
-   Responsive layout with centered content
-   Links to my socials and projects

## Tech

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (no frameworks, just pure CSS)

## Usage

Feel free to browse the source code and use it.

You can view it live at: [https://duasilva.github.io/](https://duasilva.github.io/)

## Contributing

This is a personal project. I don't really expect anyone to contribute, but I'm open to feedback, after all I'm just a beginner and have much to learn.

## License

This project is currently unlicensed but may be released under the MIT License in the future if I ever make it into something decent that people might want to use.
