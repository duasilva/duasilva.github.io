# Duarte Silva's Profile Page

Welcome to my profile page!

This is a simple, clean, and responsive personal site built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. It showcases my social media profiles, projects, a brief about me section, and includes a dark mode toggle for better usability.

## Features

-   Accessibility features, which I had no idea existed, but are pretty cool
-   Responsive layout with centered content that adapts to mobile and desktop
-   Dark mode toggle with smooth transitions
-   Background topography pattern with subtle opacity
-   Sections for About Me, Where to Find Me, Projects, and Contact

## Tech Stack

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (pure CSS with variables)
-   JavaScript (Typing animation for the page title and dark mode toggle slider)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the source code or fork it for your own use.
